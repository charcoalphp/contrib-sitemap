## Installation

The preferred (and only supported) method is with Composer:

```shell
$ composer require charcoal/contrib-sitemap
```



### Dependencies

#### Required

-   **[PHP 5.6+](https://php.net)**: _PHP 7_ is recommended.
-   **[charcoal/app][charcoal-app]**: ^4.0
-   **[charcoal/core][charcoal-core]**: ^4.0

## Service Provider

### Services

- **charcoal/sitemap/builder** Instance of `Charcoal\Sitemap\Service\Builder`.
  Used to generate collections of links from the configured models.



## Configuration

The Sitemap can be configured from the application configset under the
`sitemap` key. You can setup which objects to be included and available
translations (l10n).

Most options are renderable by objects using your application's chosen
template syntax (Mustache used in examples below).

### Default Options

```jsonc
{
    /**
     * The service's configuration point.
     */
    "sitemap": {
        /**
         * One or more groups to customize how objects should be processed.
         *
         * The array key is an arbitrary identifier for the grouping of models.
         */
        "<group-name>": {
            /**
             * Whether or not to include links to translations.
             *
             * - `true` — Multilingual. Include all translations
             *   (see `locales.languages`).
             * - `false` — Unilingual. Include only the default language
             *   (see `locales.default_language`).
             */
            "l10n": false,
            /**
             * The language to include a link to if group is unilingual.
             *
             * If `l10n` is `true`, this option is ignored.
             *

             * - `true` — Include only routable objects with active routes.

             * - `true` — Use only the object's URI (see `sitemap.*.objects.*.url`).

                             * if the child model's objects should be included
                             * in the sitemap.
                             */
                            "condition": null
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each model can override the following options of their group:
`l10n`, `locale`, `check_active_routes`, `relative_urls`.


### Example

The example below, identified as `footer_sitemap`, is marked as multilingual
using the `l10n` option which will include all translations.

```json
{
    "sitemap": {
        "footer_sitemap": {
            "l10n": true,
            "check_active_routes": true,
            "relative_urls": false,
            "objects": {
                "app/object/section": {
                    "label": "{{ title }}",
                    "url": "{{ url }}",
                    "filters": {
                        "active": {
                            "property": "active",
                            "value": true
                        }
                    },
                    "data": {
                        "id": "{{ id }}",
                        "metaTitle": "{{ metaTitle }}"
                    },
                    "children": {
                        "app/object/section-children": {
                            "condition": "{{ isAnObjectParent }}"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```



## Usage

### Using the builder

The builder returns only an array. You need to make your own conversation if you need
another format.

The Sitemap module will include all necessary service providers and set the route (sitemap.xml) directly. Include the module:

```json
"modules": {
    "charcoal/sitemap/sitemap": {}
}
```

Given the settings above:

```php
$builder = $container['charcoal/sitemap/builder'];
$sitemap = $builder->build('footer_sitemap'); // footer_sitemap is the ident of the settings you want.
```
You can also use the `SitemapBuilderAwareTrait`, which includes the setter and getter for the sitemap builder, in order
to use it with minimal code in every necessary class.



### Sitemap.xml

This contrib provides a route for `sitemap.xml` that dynamically loads the `xml` config and outputs it 
as an XML for crawlers to read.



## Development

To install the development environment:

```shell
$ composer install
```

To run the scripts (phplint, phpcs, and phpunit):

```shell
$ composer test
```

### Coding Style

The contrib-sitemap module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

-   [_PSR-1_][psr-1]
-   [_PSR-2_][psr-2]
-   [_PSR-4_][psr-4], autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_.
-   [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/) comments.
-   [phpcs.xml.dist](phpcs.xml.dist) and [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) for coding standards.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
